# mailmerge
New folder is the library I was using to get things running, "it" is the server portion i was working on getting running, massmail is the client that compiles fine I just havent figured out how to work it properly. I included the sources I got these files from in the newfolder. I got tired of trying to rename the folder so it is what it is for now.
